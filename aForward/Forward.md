# Forward

The Oakridges Moraine Groundwater Program (ORMGP), formerly the CAMC/YPDT
Groundwater Management Program), was originally initiated in 2001.  It
provides, to its partner agencies and its industry partners, technical support
in the form of a comprehensive hydrogeologic database (which includes
geological interpretations) and an understanding of groundwater flow systems
through the use of groundwater flow models.

The main components of the program are refined as more information becomes
available.

The database is the foundation for much of the groundwater work that is being
undertaken by the partner agencies.  It has been designed to store a wide
variety of information pertaining to water resources across the ORMGP study
area and to make this data readily accesible to water managers.  This
functions as a single source of the information required to fully understand
and manage water resources.

The database has grown from its roots of first using the Ministry of the
Environment (MOE) Water Well Record Database. Other data has since been added,
including: Oil and Gas wells; UGAIS wells (MNDM); geotechnical boreholes and
test wells; stream data (including both flows and water quality); climate
data; chemistry data; and scanned copies of technical reports.  The database
continues to expand with new data being incorporated on a day-to-day basis.

This manual provides a summary of the collection and organization of the 
significant amount of data that have been collated (and interpreted) so as to
facilitate water resources management initiatives.
