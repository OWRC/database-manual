## G.29 Update MOE BORE_HOLE_ID (D_LOCATION_ALIAS)

* Tables
    + D_LOCATION_ALIAS
    + tblBore_Hole (MOE WWDB; MOEDB)

* Views
    + V_SYS_MOE_LOCATIONS

* Estimated Recurrence Time: After MOE WWDB import.

Upon import of the latest version of the MOE WWDB (refer to Section G.10), a check should be made of any new mapping between a BORE_HOLE_ID (in the MOE database; MOEDB) and a LOC_ID (in the ORMGP database; ORMGPDB).  Note that this will only apply in the case of a 1:1 relationship a single WELL_ID matching a single BORE_HOLE_ID in the MOEDB; in the ORMGPDB, a single WELL_ID maps to a single LOC_ID.

This is first tested using the following script

    select
    v.loc_id
    ,t3.well_id
    ,t3.bore_hole_id
    ,v.moe_bore_hole_id
    --count(*) as rcount
    from 
    (
    select
    cast(t2.well_id as int) as well_id
    ,b2.bore_hole_id
    from 
    (
    select
    t.well_id
    from 
    (
    select
    b.well_id
    ,count(*) as bhi_num
    from 
    moe_20190509.dbo.tblbore_hole as b
    group by
    well_id
    ) as t
    where 
    t.bhi_num= 1
    ) as t2
    inner join moe_20190509.dbo.tblbore_hole as b2
    on t2.well_id=b2.well_id
    ) as t3
    inner join oak_20160831_master.dbo.v_sys_moe_locations as v
    on t3.well_id=v.moe_well_id
    where 
    v.moe_bore_hole_id is null

Any NULL values occurring in the MOE_BORE_HOLE_ID field (or any rows returned) indicate that the BORE_HOLE_ID needs to be incorporated in the D_LOCATION_ALIAS table, as follows

    insert into d_location_alias
    (
    loc_id, loc_name_alias, loc_alias_type_code, data_id, sys_temp1, sys_temp2
    )
    select
    v.loc_id
    ,cast(t3.bore_hole_id as varchar(255)) as loc_name_alias
    ,3 as loc_alias_type_code
    ,521 as data_id
    ,'20190530a' as sys_temp1
    ,20190530 as sys_temp2
    from 
    (
    select
    cast(t2.well_id as int) as well_id
    ,b2.bore_hole_id
    from 
    (
    select
    t.well_id
    from 
    (
    select
    b.well_id
    ,count(*) as bhi_num
    from 
    moe_20190509.dbo.tblbore_hole as b
    group by
    well_id
    ) as t
    where 
    t.bhi_num= 1
    ) as t2
    inner join moe_20190509.dbo.tblbore_hole as b2
    on t2.well_id=b2.well_id
    ) as t3
    inner join oak_20160831_master.dbo.v_sys_moe_locations as v
    on t3.well_id=v.moe_well_id
    where 
    v.moe_bore_hole_id is null

This process should be undertaken before examining locations for new data from the latest MOEDB.  Note the inclusion of the DATA_ID (which should correspond to the MOEDB under examination) and SYS_TEMP1/SYS_TEMP2 (making them available for any subsequent checks).
