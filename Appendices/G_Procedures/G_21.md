## G.21 Perform QA/QC Check against OAK_20120615_MASTER Backup

This process was originally implemented to examine changes and updates between
early versions of the ORMGP master database.  This has become unecessary since
the release of the 20160831 version of the database where internal checks have
been incorporated through a series of views.  Refer to Sections 2.1.5 and
2.1.6 for details.
