--***** Determine which WELL_IDs need to be added and create an existence table
--***** listing those wells; ~768401 well_ids in original db; note that for the
--***** list of missing WELL_ID's, we're also using NULL ZONE, EAST83 and NORTH83
--***** for exclusion of rows; note also that we're adding in a counter to 
--***** allow the possibility of combining info later

--***** v20210119
--***** Note that the use of V_SYS_MOE_LOCATIONS should be reevaluated during
--***** the next import; this import bypassed this section; the correction for
--***** doing so used the V_SYS_MOE_WELL_ID_DLA view instead; the previous only
--***** pulled those locations in the ORMGPDB that had a LOC_TYPE_CODE of '1',
--***** the latter does not (i.e. the former would not include those tagged for
--***** archive, error or as an upgrade); reevaluate during the next import
