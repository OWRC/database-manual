## G.12 Creation of the TRAINING Database (a Subset of the MASTER Database)

This section has been removed.  Previously, the Training database would be created by making a backup of the ORMGP master database and subsequently deleting those records that lie outside the specified Training study area (this was defined by a temporary table containing LOC_IDs that are to be used).

Refer to Appendix G.????? for details on creating a Partner database (the same methodology could be used to create a Training database).
