## G.33 Update of D_AREA_GEOM

* Tables 
    + D_AREA_GEOM

* Views
    + V_SYS_AREA_GEOM_WKB

Estimated Recurrence Time: As required.

The D_AREA_GEOM contains the boundaries (as polygons) for the various partner
agencies, the ORMGP study area as well as the extent of geologic and
hydrogeologic models.  Many of these include a buffered region as well.  This
information is stored in two columns: GEOM and GEOM_WKB.  The former holds the
default 'geometry' type for Microsoft SQL Server while the latter has been
stored in the 'Well Known Binary' format. 

The GEOM field is populated through any external GIS software that supports
the native geometry format.  The GEOM_WKB can then populated using
V_SYS_AREA_GEOM_WKB (using GEOM as a source).  If the GEOM_WKB is being
updated from an external source, a varbinary field type should be specified.

The insert statement could be of the form:

    insert into D_AREA_GEOM
    ( version, area_description, area_description_long, geom, geom_wkb )
    select
    0 as version
    ,'City of Ottawa Boundary' as area_description
    ,'This boundary was added for use with the City of Ottawa pilot project (web)' 
      as area_description_long
    ,[Geom]
    ,[geom_wkb]
    from 
    [Ottawa Region Table]

Projections can be checked through

    select
    area_id
    ,geom.STSrid
    From
    d_area_geom

which returns the EPSG projection numeric for each record/object.  This should
conform to the code '26917' (UTM Zone 17, NAD83).  If these have been
incorrectly assigned (from the external source), the specific records can be
updated using

    update d_area_geom
    set
    geom.STSrid= 26917
    where
    area_id= 76

The example here is updating the ORMGP Boundary 5km buffer layer.
