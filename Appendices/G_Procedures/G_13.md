## G.13 Synchronizing Non-Replicating Databases

There is no longer any non-replicating, separate databases - the ORMGP database is centralized and now accessed through the ORMGP web interface at

[https://www.oakridgeswater.ca](https://www.oakridgeswater.ca)

or through the Citrix XenDesktop machines (refer to Appenix I for details).  In both cases, these are (in general) read-only connections; the XenDesktop connections do allow changes/updates to be made for specific users.

For information on incorporation of database information in a similar format to the ORMGP database, refer to Appendix G.27.
