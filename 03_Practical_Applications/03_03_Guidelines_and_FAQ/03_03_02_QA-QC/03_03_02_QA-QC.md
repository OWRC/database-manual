## Section 3.3.2 QA/QC

ORMGP maintains the original datasets (in some form) at their office (in
physical or digital form).  This allows us to refer to the source data in the case of possible problems.

Metadata from each dataset (whether it be in the form or a report, readme
file, pdf, etc ...) is used to judge the accuracy and reliability of the
source information.  It is also consulted with regard to categorical data
(requiring, for example, reference tables) for conversion to that expected by
the ORMGP database (i.e. its R_\* tables and expected system units).
