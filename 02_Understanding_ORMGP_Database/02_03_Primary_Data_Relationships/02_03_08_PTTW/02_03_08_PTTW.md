## Section 2.3.8 Permit To Take Water (PTTW)

The PTTW data (refer to Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and
Parks (2022)) is provided as a single spreadsheet that requires manipulation
before incorporation into the master database.  With an absence of an
overriding key (the PERMITNO provided can be present across multiple rows in
the source data) multiple fields are examined and grouped in order to
distinguish between disparate rows in the spreadsheet (refer to
Appendix G.22 for details).  Each of these, then,
are given a specific location (i.e. a new LOC_ID) and a LOC_TYPE_CODE
of '22' ('Permit To Take Water').

The existing tables

* D_LOCATION
* D_LOCATION_PURPOSE
* D_LOCATION_QA

are used to capture information on these locations.  In addition, the tables

* D_PTTW
* D_PTTW_RELATED
* D_PTTW_RELATED_SRC
* R_PTTW_SOURCEID_CODE
* R_PTTW_WATER_SOURCE_CODE

have been added to the master database (replacing the original D_PTTW\*
tables, re-evaluated as of 2014-10-03) to capture the PTTW information as
well as make specific the relationships between the individual permits.

The individual fields within the source file are handled in the following
manner:

#### PERMITNO (Permit number for water taking)

Mapped to D_PTTW.PTTW_PERMIT_NUMBER.  Also stored in D_LOCATION.LOC_NAME.

#### CLIENTNAME (Name of client requesting a permit)
