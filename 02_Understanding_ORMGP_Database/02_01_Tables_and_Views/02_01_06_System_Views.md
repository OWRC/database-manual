## Section 2.1.6 System Views

These views are not meant for the general user.  Instead, many of the views
found in Section 2.1.5 use these as sources for accessing the data (D_\*) and
reference (R_\*) information within the database.  In addition, most of these will not remove the complexities of the table and field information and will rely upon the user having a certain familiarity with the database and the ability to write SQL code to manipulate it.

#### V_SYS_AGENCY_\*

Each partner agency and region (as well as the ORMGP study area and the 'Source Water Protection' - SWP - areas) have three views associated with them:

* V_SYS_AGENCY_\<partner agency\>
    + This view extracts all locations (i.e. the LOC_ID) that lie within the areal extent of the agency (plus a defined buffer); these locations must have valid coordinates (as defined by QA_COORD_CONFIDENCE_CODE) and are present in D_LOCATION_GEOM.   The ORMGP 'Viewlog Header Well' is included by default in this list.

* V_SYS_AGENCY_\<partner agency\>_ALL
    + This view includes all locations from V_SYS_AGENCY_<name> and adds all locations from D_DOCUMENT regardless of valid coordinates.

* V_SYS_AGENCY_\<partner agency\>_NOBUF
    + This view is similar to V_SYS_AGENCY_<name> but no buffer is added to the areal extent.

All of these views use the built-in spatial support of Microsoft SQL Server
when checking the geometric location against the geometric area (refer to
D_AREA_GEOM and D_LOCATION_GEOM).  Note that the 'SWP_\*' areas only have a single view while the ORMGP area have two.

The names of the areal extents used for each partner agency are listed as follows (the AREA_ID, from D_AREA_GEOM, is enclosed in quotes).

#### V_SYS_AREA_CA

This view returns the LOC_ID and AREA_ID for each location (as found in D_LOCATION_GEOM) when compared (using intersection) against the area polygons in D_AREA_GEOM.  This is only for the conservation authority partner agencies.  Note that this can be a slow process.

#### V_SYS_AREA_GEOMETRY_WKB

This view converts the AREA_GEOM in D_AREA_GEOM from a geometry type to a binary type.  The latter will be in 'Well Known Binary' (WKB) format -  this is supported by a number of external software packages.

#### V_SYS_AREA_REGION

This view returns the LOC_ID and AREA_ID for each location (as found in D_LOCATION_GEOM) when compared (using intersection) against the area polygons in D_AREA_GEOM.  This is only for the region partner agencies.  Note that this can be a slow process.

#### V_SYS_AREA_SWP

This view returns the LOC_ID and AREA_ID for each location (as found in D_LOCATION_GEOM) when compared (using intersection) against the area polygons in D_AREA_GEOM.  This is only for the 'Source Water Protection' (SWP) areas.  Note that this can be a slow process.

#### V_SYS_BH_BEDROCK_ELEV

This view returns the current bedrock elevation (if present) from D_BOREHOLE as well as calculating a new bedrock elevation from the geologic descriptions in D_GEOLOGY_LAYER.  Note that any material type assigned a '1' value for GEOL_MAT1_ROCK is considered bedrock for the purposes of this calculation.  In addition, a second value is calculated for the new bedrock elevation - this is limited to two decimal places (and is the value used for populated BH_BEDROCK_ELEV in D_BOREHOLE).

#### V_SYS_BH_CASING_SUMMARY

This view determines the minimum and maximum casing elevations and diameters (as well as the number of records) for each location in D_BOREHOLE.  Any diameters are also shown in inches.  This is limited to a CON_TYPE_CODE of '3' (i.e. 'Casing') in D_BOREHOLE_CONSTRUCTION.

#### V_SYS_BH_DIAMETER_ALL

Returns each of the: borehole diameter; construction diameter; and screen diameter.  The largest of these is chosen as the 
default diameter value.  All units are converted to meters.

#### V_SYS_CHK_ALIAS_NAME

This view checks for duplicate LOC_NAME_ALIAS text across multiple LOC_ID's (these cannot occur for the same LOC_ID - a built-in constraint prevents this).  This can be used to determine where multiple LOC_ID's actually refer to the same borehole/well (in particular, this can be easily applied against multiple MOE WWDB imports).  However, multiple aliases can occur for MOE nested wells; it could also occur by happenstance so an immediate problem should not be assumed.

#### V_SYS_CHK_ALIAS_NAME_MOE_TAG

This view uses V_SYS_CHK_ALIAS_NAME as a source, only extracting those rows that have a LOC_ALIAS_TYPE_CODE of '1' (i.e. 'MOE Tag Number').

#### V_SYS_CHK_BH_BEDROCK_ASSIGNED

This view uses each of V_SYS_BH_BEDROCK_ELEV, V_SYS_SUMMARY_GEOL_LAYER_NUM and D_GEOLOGY_LAYER as sources.  It returns the calculated bedrock elevation (where GEOL_MAT1_ROCK is '1' from R_GEOL_MAT1_CODE), the elevation of the next layer below this, the total number of geologic layers and the number of geologic layers below the calculated bedrock elevation (ERR_GEOL_LAYER_NUM) for a particular location.  Note that the subsequent layers cannot have a GEOL_MAT1_ROCK of '1' nor have a GEOL_MAT1_CODE of '0' (i.e. 'Unknown') or '105' (i.e. 'Refusal') and are not included if so.

#### V_SYS_CHK_BH_BEDROCK_ASSIGNED_ANY

This view, using V_SYS_CHK_BH_BEDROCK_ASSIGNED (above) as a base, returns information on the geologic layers below the calculated bedrock elevation.

#### V_SYS_CHK_BH_BEDROCK_ASSIGNED_GRANITE

This view, using V_SYS_CHK_BH_BEDROCK_ASSIGNED_ANY (above) as a base, returns rows that correspond to GEOL_MAT1_CODE of '21' (i.e. 'Granite').  Where non-rock subsequent layers exist, this is likely an error.  Additional fields are available to update D_GEOLOGY_LAYER (and remove the bedrock tag) if this is the case.

#### V_SYS_CHK_BH_BEDROCK_ASSIGNED_OTHER

This view, using V_SYS_CHK_BH_BEDROCK_ASSIGNED_ANY (above) as a base, returns rows that correspond to various GEOL_MAT1_DESCRIPTION's, including:

* Greenstone ('22')
* Basalt ('36')
* Chert ('37')
* Conglomerate ('38')
* Feldspar ('39')
* Flint ('40')
* Gneiss ('41')
* Greywacke ('42')
* Marble ('45')
* Quartz ('46')
* Soapstone ('48')

Refer to V_SYS_CHK_BH_BEDROCK_ASSIGNED_GRANITE (above) for additional details.

#### V_SYS_CHK_BH_BEDROCK_ASSIGNED_SANDSTONE

This view, using V_SYS_CHK_BH_BEDROCK_ASSIGNED_ANY (above) as a base, returns rows that correspond to GEOL_MAT1_CODE of '18' (i.e. 'Sandstone').  Refer to V_SYS_CHK_BH_BEDROCK_ASSIGNED_GRANITE (above) for additional details.

#### V_SYS_CHK_BH_BEDROCK_ASSIGNED_SHALE

This view, using V_SYS_CHK_BH_BEDROCK_ASSIGNED_ANY (above) as a base, returns rows that correspond to GEOL_MAT1_CODE of '17' (i.e. 'Shale').  Refer to V_SYS_CHK_BH_BEDROCK_ASSIGNED_GRANITE (above) for additional details.

#### V_SYS_CHK_BH_BEDROCK_ELEV_RANGE

This view uses V_SYS_BH_BEDROCK_ELEV as a base.  It returns rows where the BH_BEDROCK_ELEV (from D_BOREHOLE) is not within +/- 0.001m of the 'new' calculated bedrock elevation or is NULL.

#### V_SYS_CHK_BH_CASING_BOTTOM_MAX

This view returns the deepest bottom-of-casing depth from D_BOREHOLE_CONSTRUCTION (where CON_TYPE_CODE is '3', i.e. 'CASING', from R_CON_TYPE_CODE).  The original 'units of measure' are returned but the depth is converted to 'metres' (from 'fbgs' as necessary).  Note that if the original units are not one of 'm', 'mbgs' or 'fbgs' then a '-9999' value is returned.

#### V_SYS_CHK_BH_CONS_BOTTOM_MAX

This view returns the deepest construction detail (bottom) depth from D_BOREHOLE_CONSTRUCTION.  Refer to V_SYS_CHK_BH_CASING_BOTTOM_MAX for additional details.

#### V_SYS_CHK_BH_CONS_TOP_MAX

This view returns the deepest construction detail (top) depth from D_BOREHOLE_CONSTRUCTION.  Refer to V_SYS_CHK_BH_CASING_BOTTOM_MAX for additional details.  This is used in the case when only a top depth is present to indicated maximum depth of a borehole.

#### V_SYS_CHK_BH_DEPTH

Using V_SYS_CHK_BH_DEPTH_BASE as a source, returns those locations that do not have a depth in D_BOREHOLE that matches the 
suggested maximum depth value determine here.

#### V_SYS_CHK_BH_DEPTH_BASE

Returns the depths and elevations for a particular borehole extracted from a variety of tables (e.g. D_BOREHOLE, D_BOREHOLE_CONSTRUCTION, 
D_GEOLOGY_LAYER, etc...; note that other views are used as source of these values).  A suggest maximum depth is assembled from these values.  
See also V_SYS_CHK_BH_DEPTH.

#### V_SYS_CHK_BH_ELEV

This view returns a number of elevations associated with a borehole location where: BH_GND_ELEV is NULL; BH_DEM_GND_ELEV is NULL; or BH_GND_ELEV_OUOM is NULL.  These elevations can be used to populate the associated fields.  Note that all three fields in D_BOREHOLE should contain the same value; if BH_GND_ELEV is kept blank, SiteFX considers this row as 'new' data when re-calculating elevations.  The QA_COORD_CONFIDENCE_CODE must not be '117' (i.e. 'YPDT - Coordinate Invalid ?').

#### V_SYS_CHK_BH_ELEV_BASE

Returns all standard elevations and depths associated with a particular location along with the maximum depth and lowest elevation (based 
on the current BH_GND_ELEV).  All locations returned must have valid coordinates (based on QA_COORD_CONFIDENCE_CODE).  This should be used 
to update the D_BOREHOLE table to correction the depth and bottom elevation values.

#### V_SYS_CHK_BH_ELEV_BASE_UPDATE

Using V_SYS_CHK_BH_ELEV_BASE as a base, returns the current elevations and depths as well as the new calculated depth and bottom elevation.  
These can be used to update the appropriate fields in D_BOREHOLE.  In addition, SYS_TEMP1 and SYS_TEMP2 are populated with the current 
date (the former as a string, the latter as a numeric value).  The original depth units should also be updated.

#### V_SYS_CHK_BH_ELEV_BOT_ELEV

Using V_SYS_CHK_BH_ELEV_BASE_UPDATE as a base, returns those records where the ground and borehole bottom elevation are equivalent, the 
calculated elevation is not NULL and the depth is greater than zero.  This can be used to update D_BOREHOLE.  In addition, a new 
BH_COMMENT field is created tracking this update.

#### V_SYS_CHK_BH_ELEV_BOT_ELEV_DEPTH_EMPTY

Using V_SYS_CHK_BH_ELEV_BASE_UPDATE as a base, returns those records where the borehole bottom elevation or depth is null and the newly 
calculated bottom depth is greater than zero.  This can be used to update D_BOREHOLE.  In addition, a new BH_COMMENT field is created 
tracking this update.

#### V_SYS_CHK_BH_ELEV_MISSING

This view returns borehole and location information where the BH_GND_ELEV and BH_GND_ELEV_OUOM is NULL and LOC_COORD_EASTING and LOC_COORD_NORTHING are not.

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_DEPTH_DBORE_FBGS

Returns records from D_BOREHOLE with re=calculated elevations and depths based on the assumption that the current OUOM units are [fbgs] rather than [mbgs].  This should be used to update the table by limiting the affected records to specific locations (by LOC_ID).

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_DEPTH_DGL_FBGS

Returns records from D_GEOLOGY_LAYER with re-calculated elevations and depths based on the assumption that the current OUOM units are [fbgs] rather than [mbgs].  This should be used to update the table by limited the affected records to specific records (by GEOL_ID) or locations (by LOC_ID).

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_DEPTH_DGF_FBGS

Returns records from D_GEOLOGY_FEATURE with re-calculated elevations and depths based on the assumption that the current OUOM units are [fbgs] rather than [mbgs].  This should be used to update the table by limited the affected records to specific records (by FEATURE_ID) or locations (by LOC_ID).

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_DEPTH_DIM_FBGS

Returns records from D_INTERVAL_MONITOR with re-calculated elevations and depths based on the assumption that the current OUOM units are [fbgs] rather than [mbgs].  This should be used to update the table by limited the affected records to specific records (by MON_ID) or locations (by LOC_ID).

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_DEPTH_DIT2_FBGS

Returns records from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2 with re-calculated elevations and depths based on the assumption that the current OUOM units are [fbgs] rather than [mbgs].  This should be used to update the table by limited the affected records to specific records (by SYS_RECORD_ID), intervals (by INT_ID) or locations (by LOC_ID).

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_DEPTH_DPICK_FBGS

Returns records from D_PICK with re-calculated elevations and depths based on the assumption that the original OUOM units in D_GEOLOGY_LAYER were [fbgs] rather than [mbgs].  This should be used to update the table by limited the affected records to specific records (by SYS_RECORD_ID) or locations (by LOC_ID).

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_DEPTH_DBC_FBGS

Returns records from D_BOREHOLE_CONSTRUCTION with re-calculated elevations and depths based on the assumption that the current OUOM units are [fbgs] rather than [mbgs].  This should be used to update the table by limited the affected records to specific records (by SYS_RECORD_ID) or locations (by LOC_ID or BH_ID).

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_ELEV_CMP

Compares the BH_GND_ELEV (from D_BOREHOLE) to the ASSIGNED_ELEV (from D_LOCATION_ELEV), returning those records where the difference does 
not fall with the range of +/- [SYS_ELEV_RANGE] (from S_CONSTANT).  Only valid locations are examined (i.e. excluded QA_COORD_CONFICENCE_CODEs 
[117] and [118])

Note that this can return multiple records for a location if there are multiple records in D_LOCATION_ELEV_HIST and they fall within the range 
of the BH_GND_ELEV value.

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_ELEV_CMP_UNQ

Using V_SYS_CHK_CORR_ELEV_CMP as a base, returns only those locations for which a single record is found (i.e. there are not multiple values 
in D_LOCATION_ELEV_HIST that can be considered possible corrections)

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_ELEV_D2

Returns those records from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2 where the RD_VALUE does not match a recalculated value where the original units are expressed as depths (e.g. [mbgs], [fbgs], etc...) within a specified uncertainty.  V_SYS_INT_REF_ELEV_RANGE is used as a base for the reference elevation.  The original values must be populated.  This can be used to update the values in the temporal table.

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_ELEV_D5

Returns those records from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_5 where the RD_VALUE does not match a recalculated value where the original units are expressed as depths (e.g. [mbgs], [fbgs], etc...) within a specified uncertainty.  V_SYS_INT_REF_ELEV_RANGE is used as a base for the reference elevation.  The original values must be populated.  This can be used to update the values in the temporal table.

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_ELEV_DBC

Returns those records from D_BOREHOLE_CONSTRUCTION where the CON_TOP_ELEV or CON_BOT_ELEV do not match the recalculated values within a specified uncertainty.  This can be used to update the values in the latter table.

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_ELEV_DBORE

Returns those records from D_BOREHOLE where the BH_BOTTOM_ELEV does not match the recalculated value within a specified uncertainty.  This can be used to update the value in the latter table.

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_ELEV_DGF

Returns those records from D_GEOLOGY_FEATURE where the FEATURE_TOP_ELEV or FEATURE_BOT_ELEV do not match the recalculated values within a specfiied uncertainty.  This can be used to update the values in the latter table.

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_ELEV_DGL

Returns those records from D_GEOLOGY_LAYER where the GEOL_TOP_ELEV or GEOL_BOT_ELEV do not match the recalculated values within a specfied uncertainty.  This can be used to update the values in the latter table.

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_ELEV_DIM

Returns those records from D_INTERVAL_MONITOR where the MON_TOP_ELEV or MON_BOT_ELEV do not match the recalculated values within a specified uncertainty.  This can be used to update the values in the latter table.

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_ELEV_DIRE

Using V_SYS_INT_REF_ELEV_RANGE as a base, returns those records where the REF_ELEV value (from D_INTERVAL_REF_ELEV) does not match a re-calculated reference elevation (incorporating REF_STICK_UP and BH_GND_ELEV) within a specified uncertainty.  This can be used to update the values in the latter table.

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_ELEV_DIS

Returns those records from D_INTERVAL_SOIL where the SOIL_TOP_ELEV or SOIL_BOT_ELEV do not match the recalculated values within a specified uncertainty.  This can be used to update the values in the latter table.

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_ELEV_DPICK

Using V_SYS_CHK_ELEV_DPICK as a base, returns those records from D_PICK where the TOP_ELEV does not match a re-calculated top elevation (within a specified uncertainty).  This can be used to update the values in the latter table.

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_ELEV_TAG

This view returns those locations (and their coordinates) who have COORD_CHECK tagged field (with a default value of [10000]) in D_LOOCATION_GEOM.  
This is used as a preliminary step in the processing of elevation corrections by location when coordinates have been changed/updated (namely that 
of determining the new elevation using an external GIS source).

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_TEMP_D2

Returns records from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2 that should be standardized to the
UNIT_CODE [3] (i.e. [C]).  No translation of RD_VALUEs was currently found
necessary.

#### V_SYS_CHK_CORR_WLS_BARO

In some cases, barometric data has been incorporated without correction of an offset value; this can be found, in general where the imported values are less than [300]; these values are corrected by adding the offset (of [950]) back to the original value; both [cmap baro] and [map bar] are corrected

#### V_SYS_CHK_DGL_BEDROCK

Returns all LOC_IDs where a bedrock material (as defined in the
R_GEOL_MAT1_CODE column GEOL_MAT1_ROCK) is present in GEOL_MAT1_CODE in
D_GEOLOGY_LAYER

#### V_SYS_CHK_DGL_COUNTS

This view returns the number of geologic layers in D_GEOLOGY_LAYER as well as the number of these layers that consist only of whole numbers.  Likely, multiple rows of whole numbers for a particular location indicate that the row(s) should likely have the units 'fbgs' (or similar).

#### V_SYS_CHK_DGL_DEPTHS_MOE

This view returns information from D_GEOLOGY_LAYER where: the location is identified as from the MOE WWDB; the units for the row is identified as 'mbgs'; the values for the row are whole numbers; the GEOL_SUBCLASS_CODE is not '5' (i.e. 'Original (or Corrected)').  The MOE_PDF_LINK is incorporated from W_GENERAL.  A total number of geologic layers as well as the number of geologic layers whose depths are whole numbers is calculated.

#### V_SYS_CHK_DGL_ELEVS

Returns the original and re-calculated elevations (based on BH_GND_ELEV) for the records in D_GEOLOGY_LAYER where these two sets of values do not match 
(within a specified uncertainty).  Note that SYS_TEMP1 and SYS_TEMP2 are tagged with the current date (such that they can be used as flagged values).  
The OUOM values must be populated with units of either [mbgs] or [fbgs].

#### V_SYS_CHK_DGL_ELEV_OUOM

Recalculates the GEOL_TOP_OUOM and GEOL_BOT_OUOM values in D_GEOLOGY_LAYER where the GEOL_UNIT_OUOM is recorded in [masl] or [fasl] (converting them 
to a depth, instead).  When using this to update the table, remember to update the original units field.

#### V_SYS_CHK_DGL_MAT1_DCR

This view checks D_GEOLOGY_LAYER where the particular location has an INT_TYPE_CODE of '27' ('Decommissioned'; i.e. DCR) and returns the number of geologic layers whose materials match common 'fill' (i.e. well decommissioning) materials.  These include:

* Clay ('5')
* Fill ('1')
* Gravel ('11')
* Limestone ('28')
* Stones ('12') 

The count of these layers as well as the count of the total number of geologic layers (from V_SYS_SUMMARY_GEOL_LAYER_NUM) is returned.  If these values match (or are close) then it's possible that the well is decommissioned (otherwise, it may be a valid well/borehole).  

#### V_SYS_CHK_DGL_MAT1_NULL_DCR

This view checks D_GEOLOGY_LAYER where the particular location has an INT_TYPE_CODE of '27' ('Decommissioned'; i.e. DCR) and returns the number of geologic layers where the GEOL_MAT1_CODE is NULL.  The total number of geologic layers (from V_SYS_SUMMARY_GEOL_LAYER_NUM) is returned as well.  If these values match, it's likely that the well is decommissioned.

#### V_SYS_CHK_DGL_MULT_UNIT_OUOM

This view examines the D_GEOLOGY_LAYER looking for rows, from a single location, where differing 'original units of measure' (OUOM) for depth have been used (i.e. the field GEOL_UNIT_OUOM).  These rows should subsequently be updated to a single measurement unit consistent for that location.  Note that this should be done before a number of the other V_SYS_CHK_DGL_* views are examined.

#### V_SYS_CHK_DGL_SINGLE_LIME

This view returns those locations where only a single geologic layer has been specified (using V_SYS_GEOL_LAY_UNIT_OUOM) and that layer material type has been specified as GEOL_MAT1_CODE '15' (i.e. 'Limestone').  Note that the GEOL_SUBCLASS_CODE (which is used to 'tag' those locations that have been checked and/or corrected) must have a NULL value.  This is used to determine those possible locations (generally from the MOE) where the original record is for decommissioning a well (and the limestone reference here is for 'limestone screenings' or gravel).  However, in many cases, a single record of limestone will be correct; this should be handled on a case-by-case basis.

#### V_SYS_CHK_DGL_SINGLE_UNKN

This view is similar to V_SYS_CHK_DGL_SINGLE_LIME (above) with the exception that GEOL_MAT1_CODE is '0' (i.e. 'Unknown').

#### V_SYS_CHK_DGL_SINGLE_UNKN_SFC

This view is similar to V_SYS_CHECK_DGL_SINGLE_UNKN; here, though, an additional check is made as to whether the layer is occurring at surface (i.e. GEOL_TOP_OUOM is '0').

#### V_SYS_CHK_DGL_SINGLE_UNKN_SFC_NOPUMP

This view is similar to V_SYS_CHK_DGL_SINGLE_UNKNOWN_SFC; here, though, an additional check is made as to whether there is any pumping information associated with this location.

#### V_SYS_CHK_DGL_SINGLE_UNKN_SFC_NOPUMP_ABD

This view is similar to V_SYS_CHK_DGL_SINGLE_UNKN_SFC_NOPUMP; here, though, an additional check is made as to whether the locations LOC_STATUS_CODE has a value of '3' (i.e. 'Abandoned').

#### V_SYS_CHK_DGL_UNITS

This view returns information from D_GEOLOGY_LAYER using locations (i.e. the LOC_ID) that appear in V_SYS_CHK_DGL_COUNTS.  This allows a check of the depth units for the complete geology at a particular location.

#### V_SYS_CHK_DGL_UNITS_UPDATE

Returns the original and re-calculated elevations (based on a non-null BH_GND_ELEV) for the records in D_GEOLOGY_LAYER where the OUOM values are entirly 
whole numbers and the current units are [mbgs].  These values are interpreted as being, instead, in [fbgs] and should be updated.  Note that for consistency, 
all of the records in D_GEOLOGY_LAYER must be whole numbers.  In addition, SYS_TEMP1 and SYS_TEMP2 are tagged with the current date (such that they can be 
used as flagged values).

#### V_SYS_CHK_DIFA_[model]_ADD

Using V_SYS_LOC_MODEL_[model] as a base, returns those records/intervals that
should be added to D_INTERVAL_FORM_ASSIGN for that particular model.  These
views include each of CM2004, DM2007, ECM2006, RM2004, WB2018, WB2021 and YT32011
models.

#### V_SYS_CHK_DIFA_[model]_REMOVE

Returns those records/intervals that should be removed from
D_INTERVAL_FORM_ASSIGN that should no longer be considered as touching upon
the particular [model] area.  These views include each of CM2004, DM2007, 
ECM2006, RM2004, WB2018, WB2021 and YT32011 models.

#### V_SYS_CHK_DIFA_GL_[geologic unit]_[model]_THICK

Using V_SYS_DIFA_GL_[geologic unit]_[model] as a base, extracts those records
from D_INTERVAL_FORM_ASSIGN that have a top- or bottom-layer assigned to the
[geologic unit] for the particular [model] and currently does not have a
record of thickness of the layer at this location (i.e. it is currently set to
NULL).

#### V_SYS_CHK_DIRE

This view returns pertinent information from D_INTERVAL_REF_ELEV with regard to interval reference elevations.  Of particular importance is the transformation 
of REF_POINT from a text field to a numeric value allowing for direct update of REF_STICK_UP and REF_OFFSET.

Note that REF_POINT is used to store the stick up value for the interval as it is the only one of the offset fields available to be modified by SiteFX.

#### V_SYS_CHK_DLCH_ALL_ELEV_ID

Returns the coordinates for a location from D_LOCATION along with the current coordinates from D_LOCATION_COORD_HIST where there is no LOC_ELEV_ID (i.e. an elevation) 
directly associated with these records (in the latter table).  Note that the QA_COORD_CONFIDENCE_CODE must be valid.

#### V_SYS_CHK_DLCH_BH_ELEV_ID

Using V_SYS_CHK_DLCH_ALL_ELEV_ID as a source, includes the BH_GND_ELEV from D_BOREHOLE.

#### V_SYS_CHK_DLSH_ELEV_UPD

Returns those LOC_IDs from D_LOCATION_GEOM (as well as their associated coordinates and spatial id) whose position has been checked (or changed) and whose 
elevation needs to be updated.  These are marked with a COORD_CHECK value matching DEF_DLSH_ELEV_UPD.

This can be used by an external GIS to associated a new elevation with a spatial id.

#### V_SYS_CHK_DOC_AUTHOR_AGENCY

This view assembles information from D_DOCUMENT where the DOC_AUTHOR_AGENCY_CODE is NULL (or the DOC_AUTHOR_AGENCY_DESCRIPTION is NULL).

#### V_SYS_CHK_DOC_YN_FIELDS

This view examines the D_DOCUMENT table, specifically the '*_YN' fields.  It reassigns all '0' values to NULL and all '-1' values to '1' (for consistency).  These values need to be reassigned back to the source table.

#### V_SYS_CHK_ELEV_DBORE

Returns those records from D_BOREHOLE where BH_GND_ELEV does not match ASSIGNED_ELEV in D_LOCATION_ELEV (within a specified uncertainty).  The latter is 
also returned along with the associated record in D_LOCATION_ELEV_HIST and coordinate information from D_LOCATION.  The coordinates must be valid.

#### V_SYS_CHK_ELEV_DBORE_UPD

This view returns those records from D_BOREHOLE and D_LOCATION_ELEV where the BH_GND_ELEV varies from the ASSIGNED_ELEV beyond a specified minimum 
range (as determined by the SYS_ELEV_RANGE constant in S_CONSTANT).  Pertinent information is included from D_LOCATION, D_LOCATION_QA and 
D_LOCATION_ELEV_HIST in order to determine the reason for the change in elevation.  New elevations should be added to D_LOCATION_ELEV_HIST following 
by an update of D_LOCATION_ELEV. Various information is assembled in fields to allow easy update of the requisite tables.

Note that only locations with valid QA_COORD_CONFIDENCE_CODEs (i.e. not [117] or [118]) will be examined.  In addition, BH_GND_ELEV cannot be null 
and the LOC_ELEV_CODE (from D_LOCATION_ELEV_HIST) must be [null] or have a value of [3] (i.e. DEM - MNR 10m v2).

#### V_SYS_CHK_ELEV_DPICK

Checks elevation of pick (from D_PICK) against the elevations in D_BOREHOLE and D_LOCATION_ELEV.  Calculates new elevations based upon these two values.

#### V_SYS_CHK_GEOL_LAY_BOT_ELEV_DEPTH

This view returns the deepest geologic layer elevation and calculated depth (for the latter, subtracting the smallest elevation value from the largest elevation value).

#### V_SYS_CHK_GEOL_LAY_ELEV

This view returns a subset of D_GEOLOGY_LAYER information as well as associated elevation (from D_LOCATION_ELEV) for all locations.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_ELEVS_DEPTHS

This view returns all associated elevations and depths for all intervals.  This includes all elevations from D_BOREHOLE, D_INTERVAL_REF_ELEV (including REF_STICK_UP and REF_OFFSET) and D_LOCATION_ELEV_HIST.  In addition, each of the following is included: the deepest geologic formation from D_GEOLOGY_LAYER; the top and bottom elevation and depths from D_INTERVAL_MONITOR; the deepest construction bottom from D_BOREHOLE_CONSTRUCTION; and the average water level elevation (and calculated depth) from D_INTERVAL_SUMMARY.  Only those locations with valid coordinates are examined.

This was originally used for correcting borehole depths (and screen depths).

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_ELEVS_DEPTHS_\*

These series of views use V_SYS_CHK_INT_ELEVS_DEPTHS as a base with comparisons between fields specifically defined to detect particular errors (in borehole depth, screen elevations, etc?).  All of these views do not consider any location whose QA_COORD_CONFIDENCE_CODE is '118' (i.e. 'YPDT - Assigned Township Centroid').  These include

* V_SYS_CHK_INT_ELEVS_DEPTHS_BH_MON_BOT_DIFF
    + This view returns those rows whose BH_BOTTOM_ELEV and MON_BOTTOM_ELEV have a difference greater than '10m'.
* V_SYS_CHK_INT_ELEVS_DEPTHS_BH_VS_MAX
    + This view returns those rows whose BH_BOTTOM_DEPTH (plus '0.1m') is less than the MAX_DEPTH_M (i.e. the borehole bottom depth from D_BOREHOLE is above the maximum calculated depth available).
* V_SYS_CHK_INT_ELEVS_DEPTHS_BH_VS_MON_BOT
    + This view returns those rows whose BH_BOTTOM_ELEV is greater than the MON_BOT_ELEV (plus '0.1m'; i.e. the borehole bottom elevation from D_BOREHOLE is above the bottom of the screen elevation).  
* V_SYS_CHK_INT_ELEVS_DEPTHS_BH_VS_WL
    + This view returns those rows whose BH_BOTTOM_ELEV is greater than the WL_AVG_MASL (i.e. the average water level is below the bottom of the borehole).
* V_SYS_CHK_INT_ELEVS_DEPTHS_MON_BOT_LT_0
    + This view returns those rows whose MON_BOT_ELEV has a value less than zero.
* V_SYS_CHK_INT_ELEVS_DEPTHS_MON_BOT_TOP
    + This view returns those rows whose MON_BOT_ELEV is above that of the MON_TOP_ELEV (i.e. the top and bottom screen elevations are likely reversed).
* V_SYS_CHK_INT_ELEVS_DEPTHS_MON_M_LT_0
    + This view returns those rows whose MON_TOP_DEPTH_M or MON_BOT_DEPTH_M are less than zero.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_MON_DEPTHS_M

This view returns the calculated screen depths from D_INTERVAL_MONITOR where MON_TOP_DEPTH_M and MON_BOT_DEPTH_M is NULL and MON_TOP_OUOM and MON_BOT_OUOM is not NULL.  Using the OUOM fields, the depths are calculated for the original units of 'mbgs', 'fbgs' and 'masl' (which is subtracted from ASSIGNED_ELEV); a '-9999' tag is returned for other units.  Only those with valid coordinates are examined.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_MON_ELEV_DEPTH

This view returns the current depths and elevations from D_INTERVAL_MONITOR as well as BH_GND_ELEV, BH_GND_BOTTOM_ELEV and BH_BOTTOM_DEPTH from D_BOREHOLE.   The ASSIGNED_ELEV is extracted from D_LOCATION_ELEV and LOC_ELEV_MASL_ORIG is from V_SYS_ELEV_ORIGINAL. This should be used as a check between the borehole depth and screened interval depth.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_MISSING

Assembles information from D_LOCATION for input into D_INTERVAL where no record 
currently exists.  This only applies to regional locations specified through the 
LOC_STUDY field in D_LOCATION.

Note that this is limited to interval types [Well or Borehole], [Surface Water], 
[Climate Station] and [Pumping Station].

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_MON_MISSING

Assembles information from D_INTERVAL for input into D_INTERVAL_MONITOR where no 
record currently exists.  This only applies to regional locations specified through 
the LOC_STUDY field in D_LOCATION.

Note that this is limited to interval types [Surface Water Flow Gauge], 
[Surface Water Spot Stage Elevation], [Screen Information Omitted] and 
[Pumping Station].

Used in conjunction with V_SYS_CHK_INT_MISSING, this allows locations to be 
included in the V_CON_\* views highlighting their missing information.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_REF_ELEV

This view returns those locations where the ASSIGNED_ELEV (from D_LOCATION_ELEV) does not lie within the REF_ELEV minus the REF_STICK_UP (from D_INTERVAL_REF_ELEV).  Only those locations where ASSIGNED_ELEV matches BH_GND_ELEV (from D_BOREHOLE) and only a single record (for the particular interval) is present in D_INTERVAL_REF_ELEV (using V_SYS_INT_REF_ELEV_COUNT) are considered.  The reference ground elevation, the new reference elevation (using ASSIGNED_ELEV and REF_STICK_UP) and the absolute difference between ASSIGNED_ELEV and the reference ground elevation is calculated.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_REF_ELEV2

This view returns locations similarly to V_SYS_CHK_INT_REF_ELEV for those locations with multiple records (i.e. time intervals) in D_INTERVAL_REF_ELEV.  The REF_ELEV_START_DATE and REF_ELEV_END_DATE are included; the latter is assigned the current date if, at present, it is NULL (i.e. it is the current reference elevation record).

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_REF_ELEV2_DIT2

This view is equivalent to V_SYS_CHK_INT_REF_ELEV_DIT2 (below) for those intervals with multiple records in D_INTERVAL_REF_ELEV.  The start and end dates are used to determine the applicable 'new' reference elevation.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_REF_ELEV2_DIT2_DEPTHS

This view is equivalent to V_SYS_CHK_INT_REF_ELEV_DIT2_DEPTHS (below) for those intervals with multiple records in D_INTERVAL_REF_ELEV (using V_SYS_CHK_INT_REF_ELEV2_DIT2 as a source).

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_REF_ELEV2_ERR

This view returns all records from D_INTERVAL_REF_ELEV where multiple reference elevations have been specified but their date ranges are invalid.  This should be used to correct those date ranges.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_REF_ELEV_CURRENT

Using V_SYS_INT_REF_ELEV_CURRENT as a base, checks D_INTERVAL_REF_ELEV for reference elevation date ranges that overlap with the current date range 
(starting from REF_ELEV_START_DATE).  When this occurs, RCOUNT will have a value greater than [1] for a particular INT_ID.  These should be corrected.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_REF_ELEV_DIT2

This view returns all records from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2 for intervals present in V_SYS_CHK_REF_ELEV and with READING_GROUP_CODE of '23' (i.e. 'Water Level').  This can be used to determine those records that could be affected by updating (i.e. correcting) the reference elevation (the new, calculated reference elevation is included).

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_REF_ELEV_DIT2_DEPTHS

This view returns all records from V_SYS_CHK_INT_REF_ELEV_DIT2 where the original units of measure are depths (e.g. 'mbgs', 'fbgs', etc?) - these are the only records that should be modified by a change in REF_ELEV.  Units such as 'masl' should remain unchanged.  The corrected RD_VALUE is present in RD_VALUE_NEW.  The SYS_RECORD_ID from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2 is included.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_REF_OFFSET

Returns those records from D_INTERVAL_REF_ELEV (and using V_SYS_INT_REF_ELEV_RANGE) where REF_POINT (converted to a numeric value) does not match 
REF_STICK_UP (in metres) within a specified uncertainty.  This should be used to correct REF_STICK_UP as changes using SiteFX are only applied to REF_POINT.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_SOIL_DEPTHS_M

This view returns the calculated SOIL_TOP_M and SOIL_BOT_M from D_INTERVAL_SOIL.  Both depths ('fbgs' and 'mbgs') and elevations ('masl'; the latter in conjunction with ASSIGNED_ELEV) in the original units of measure are used; a value of '-9999' is otherwise returned.  The original values must be present and the SOIL_TOP_M and SOIL_BOT_M must be NULL.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_SUM_ADD

This view returns a list of INT_ID's not present in D_INTERVAL_SUMMARY.  This is used to automatically update the table with new intervals.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_SUM_REMOVE

This view turns a list of INT_ID's that exist in D_INTERVAL_SUMMARY but are no longer found in D_INTERVAL.  This is used to automatically remove rows from the summary table.  Note that CASCADE rules are present as part of the database schema to automatically remove intervals from this table once they have been removed from D_INTERVAL.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP1A_SAID

Returns a list of SAM_IDs present in D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_1A that likely refer to the same sample (grouped by INT_ID, SAM_SAMPLE_DATE and SAM_SAMPLE_NAME).  
In addition, a new SYS_ANALYIS_ID is calculated to allow these disparate SAM_IDs to be grouped.  Note that only those records that have a current 
SYS_ANALYSIS_ID value of NULL are examined.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP1A_SAMID

This view returns a list of SAM_ID's from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_1A that have no related records in D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_1B.  This should be used to remove these records.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP1B_MOVE

Assembles the records from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_1A and D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_1B into a format that can be used as an input into D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2.  In 
some cases, data is loaded into the former tables that should be located in the latter table - this allows the easy transfer between the two (the records 
would then be deleted in the _1A/_1B tables).

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP1B_SAMID

This view returns a list of SAM_ID's from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_1B that have no related records in D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_1A.  This should be used to remove these records.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP1_DUPLICATES

This view returns duplicate records from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_1B/1A using comparisons between INT_ID, RD_NAME_CODE, SAM_SAMPLE_DATE, RD_VALUE and UNIT_CODE.  The number of records and the minimum SYS_RECORD_ID (from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_1B) is also returned - the latter is chosen, by default, to remain in the database.  Refer to V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP1_DUPLICATES_DEL_SRI, below.  Information from D_DATA_SOURCE (tagged by DATA_ID) is included.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP1_DUPLICATES_DEL_SRI

This view returns the duplicate row SYS_RECORD_ID values - these can be used to remove the records from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_1B.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP1_DUPLICATES_NUM

This view, using V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP1_DUPLICATES as a source, returns the number of duplicate records in D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_1B.  This includes all rows.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP1_DUPLICATES_NUM_DEL

This view, using V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP1_DUPLICATES as a source, returns the number of records to be deleted from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_1B.  This value should be less than that returned from V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP1_DUPLICATES_NUM.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP1_UNITS

This view returns those records from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_1A and D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_1B where units in the latter table are inappropriate for lab-based analysis (e.g.'masl' and 'mbgs'; any rows tagged with these units should likely be in D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2).

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP2_DUPLICATES

This view returns duplicate records from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2 using comparisons between INT_ID, RD_NAME_CODE, RD_DATE, RD_VALUE and UNIT_CODE.  The number of records and the minimum as well as the maximum SYS_RECORD_ID (from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2) is also returned - the minimum is usually chosen, by default, to remain in the database.  Refer to V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP2_DUPLICATES_DEL_SRI, below.  Information from D_DATA_SOURCE (tagged by DATA_ID) is included.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP2_DUPLICATES2

This view is similar to V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP2_DUPLICATES.  In this case, though,
the UNIT_CODE and RD_TYPE_CODE is not used for grouping records to find those
that are duplicates.  This should be used carefully and no automatic view
should subsequently be used to delete the records.  An example of its use can
be found in Appendix G.35.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP2_DUPLICATES_DEL_SRI

This view returns the duplicate row SYS_RECORD_ID values - these can be used to remove the records from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2.  The minimum SYS_RECORD_ID (i.e. MIN_SYS_RECORD_ID) is used in this case.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP2_DUPLICATES_NUM

This view, using V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP2_DUPLICATES as a source, returns the number of duplicate records in D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2.  This includes all rows.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP2_DUPLICATES_NUM_DEL

This view, using V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP2_DUPLICATES as a source, returns the number of records to be deleted from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2.  This value should be less than that returned from V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP2_DUPLICATES_NUM.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP2_SOIL

This view returns all records from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2 that are associated with soil intervals (i.e. INT_TYPE_CODE '29').

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP5_DUPLICATES

Returns duplicate records from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_5 using comparisons between: INT_ID, RD_NAME_CODE, RD_DATE, RD_VALUE and UNIT_CODE.  The number of 
records and the minimum as well as the maximum SYS_RECORD_ID is also returned.  The minimum is usually chosen, by default, to remain in the database.  
Information from D_DATA_SOURCE (tagged by DATA_ID) is included.

#### V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP5_DUPLICATES_DEL_SRI

Returns the duplicate SYS_RECORD_ID values using V_SYS_CHK_INT_TMP2_DUPLICATES as a source.  These can be used to remove the records from 
D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2 (using the minimum SYS_RECORD_ID in this case).

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_ADDRESS

This view is to be used as an aid for correcting location position, it returns various address fields as well as the current and original coordinates.  
In addition, the translated township and country descriptions (based upon LOC_TOWNSHIP_CODE) are included.  If the location is an MOE borehole, the 
MOE PDF link is returned.

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_COORDS

This view returns the coordinate and coordinate-quality information (from D_LOCATION and D_LOCATION_QA) where LOC_COORD_EASTING or LOC_COORD_NORTHING is NULL.  Only QA_COORD_CONFIDENCE_CODE's that do not have a value of '117' (i.e. 'YPDT - Invalid ?') are considered.

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_COORDS_CHECK

This view returns those locations whose spatial coordinates in D_LOCATION_GEOM (i.e. in GEOM) do not match the (x,y) coordinates in D_LOCATION (i.e. LOC_COORD_EASTING and LOC_COORD_NORTHING).  This is signified by COORD_CHECK (in D_LOCATION_GEOM) having a non-null value (this column is increment using a weekly check process).  The CURRENT_COORD coordinates from D_LOCATION_COORD_HIST, if available, are also returned.  This should be used to monitor and correct invalid changes in coordinates.

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_COORDS_CHECK_UPDATE

This view returns the calculated GEOM and GEOM_WKB for a location where COORD_CHECK (from D_LOCATION_GEOM) is not null; the latter signifies that a change has been made in the coordinates that do match the spatial geometry (i.e. GEOM).  Note that the current coordinates in D_LOCATION_COORD_HIST must match the coordinate values in D_LOCATION.  The two spatial geometry fields, here, should be used to update the fields in D_LOCATION_GEOM.

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_COORDS_CURR

This view returns the coordinates from D_LOCATION where the location currently has no recorded values in D_LOCATION_COORD_HIST.  This is used to update the latter table - a CURRENT_COORD field is present set to a '1' value (indicating that this is the current coordinates).  Note that there must be a valid coordinate in either (or both) of LOC_COORD_EASTING or LOC_COORD_NORTHING.

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_ELEV

This view extracts all elevations from D_LOCATION_ELEV_HIST and D_BORHOLE where the ASSIGNED_ELEV in D_LOCATION_ELEV is NULL.  This can be used to populate the latter table (with an ASSIGNED_ELEV value).  Note that this is an older view and should be updated to incorporate changes in the two location-elevation tables or discarded.

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_ELEV_ASSIGNED_ALL

This view returns all elevations from the D_LOCATION_ELEV and D_LOCATION_ELEV_HIST (the latter through a series of views) associated with a particular location.

V_SYS_CHK_LOC_ELEV_BH_ELEV

This view returns all elevations similar to V_SYS_CHK_LOC_ELEV_ASSIGNED_ALL but only for those locations whose ASSIGNED_ELEV does not match BH_GND_ELEV (from D_BOREHOLE) within a range of '+/- 0.0001m'.  The QA_COORD_CONFIDENCE_CODE cannot have a value of '117' (i.e. 'YPDT - Coordinate Invalid ?').  This allows comparisons between the elevation tables and D_BOREHOLE as the latter can be modified readily in SiteFX.

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_ELEV_BH_ELEV_MOD

Returns all records from V_SYS_CHK_LOC_ELEV_BH_ELEV and adds various SYS_ fields from D_BOREHOLE and D_LOCATION_QA for user modification tracking.

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_ELEV_MISSING

This view returns all locations (by LOC_ID) that are currently not found in D_LOCATION_ELEV (i.e. there is no ASSIGNED_ELEV).  Note that LOC_TYPE_CODE's '22' (i.e. 'Permit to Take Water') and '25' (i.e. 'Documents') are excluded.  The QA_COORD_CONFIDENCE_CODE for the location cannot be '117' (i.e. 'YPDT - Coordinate Invalid ?').

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_ELEV_MISSING_DEM_GEOM

This view returns the LOC_ID and GEOM from D_LOCATION_GEOM; this is mainly used to determine various DEM elevations for these locations.  Note that LOC_TYPE_CODE's '22' (i.e. 'Permit to Take Water') and '25' (i.e. 'Documents') are excluded as well as those locations with a QA_COORD_CONFIDENCE_CODE of '117' (i.e. 'YPDT - Coordinate Invalid ?') or '118' (i.e. 'YPDT - Assigned Township Centroid ?').  The location is excluded, in addition, if it already has the elevations from the 'DEM - MNR 10m v2' or 'DEM - SRTM 90m v41' surfaces (i.e. LOC_ELEV_CODE's '3' and '5' as found in D_LOCATION_ELEV_HIST). 

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_ELEV_MISSING_GEOM

Using V_SYS_CHK_LOC_ELEV_MISSING as a source this view returns the LOC_ID and GEOM for each location.

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_ELEV_MISSING_LIST

This view returns all elevations associated with a particular location using V_SYS_CHK_LOC_ELEV_MISSING and V_SYS_CHK_LOC_ELEV_ASSIGNED_ALL as sources.  This can be used to determine the ASSIGNED_ELEV to be used for a location.

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_ELEV_MISSING_LIST_QA

This view returns all elevations associated with a particular location (using V_SYS_CHK_LOC_ELEV_MISSING_LIST) with the addition of the particular QA/QC codes and various other information allowing for direct addition into D_LOCATION_ELEV_HIST.

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_ELEV_SURV_NULL

This view returns all elevations associated with a particular location (similarly to V_SYS_CHK_LOC_ELEV_MISSING_LIST) where the QA_ELEV_CONFIDENCE_CODE is '1' (i.e. it has been surveyed) but no surveyed elevation is present in D_LOCATION_ELEV_HIST (i.e. having a LOC_ELEV_CODE of '1').  This should be used to determine the input surveyed elevation.

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_GEOM_ADD

This view returns any LOC_ID not currently present in D_LOCATION_GEOM (that has a valid location).  This is used to automatically add missing locations into the latter table.

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_GEOM_CHANGE

This view returns any LOC_ID where the calculated spatial geometry (from V_SYS_LOC_GEOMETRY) does not match the stored spatial geometry in D_LOCATION_GEOM.  This is used to automatically tag locations whose coordinates should be checked.  Note that this view uses the built-in function 'STEquals' for spatial geometry comparisons (the function returns a '1' if they match, a '0' otherwise).

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_GEOM_COORD_CHECK

This returns all locations as well as their spatial geometry from D_LOCATION_GEOM where COORD_CHECK is not NULL.  The latter indicates where the spatial geometry differs from the current LOC_COORD_EASTING and LOC_COORD_NORTHING in D_LOCATION.

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_GEOM_COORD_CHECK_REVIEW

This view returns the original spatial geometries (both GEOM and GEOM_WKB) as well as the new calculated spatial geometries (new_GEOM and new_GEOM_WKB) for a location where the COORD_CHECK value is not NULL.  This can be used to update D_LOCATION_GEOM after checking.

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_GEOM_REMOVE

This view returns all locations (by LOC_ID) from D_LOCATION_GEOM that no longer exist in D_LOCATION.  Note that the database schema has been updated with CASCADE statements to automate this removal process - this view may be removed in the future.

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_GEOM_WKB_UPDATE

This view returns all locations (by LOC_ID) where GEOM_WKB in D_LOCATION_GEOM is currently a NULL value.  This is used to tag locations where this field should be populated.

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_SUM_ADD

This view returns all locations (by LOC_ID) from D_LOCATION that are currently not found in D_LOCATION_SUMMARY.  This is used to automatically add locations to the latter table.

#### V_SYS_CHK_LOC_SUM_REMOVE

This view returns all locations (by LOC_ID) from D_LOCATION_SUMMARY that are no longer found in D_LOCATION.  This is used to automatically remove locations from the former table.  Note that changes to the database schema using CASCADE statements  may have made the use of this view surplus - it may be removed in the future.

#### V_SYS_CHK_MOE_WELL_ID_ATAG

Returns the MOE ATAG and associated MOE_WELL_ID by location.  Note that, in this case, an MOE well is defined as having a MOE_WELL_ID in the D_LOCATION_ALIAS table (i.e. an LOC_ALIAS_TYPE_CODE of [1]).

#### V_SYS_CHK_MOE_WELL_ID_DUP

One of the views used to determine whether multiple boreholes have been imported that are, in reality, the describing the same location.  
This view examines the D_LOCATION_ALIAS table, grouping by LOC_NAME_ALIAS for MOE_WELL_IDs (i.e. LOC_ALIAS_TYPE_CODE of [4]) and returning 
those records (and their related D_LOCATION information) where the MOE_WELL_ID has been applied to multiple locations.

#### V_SYS_CHK_MOE_WELL_ID_DUP_UPD

One of the views used to determine whether multiple boreholes have been imported that could be describing the same location.  
Using V_SYS_CHK_MOE_WELL_ID_DUP as a base, this view returns for each MOE_WELL_ID: the LOC_ID and (possibly) duplicate LOC_IDs; 
the LOC_MASTER_LOC_ID and duplicate LOC_MASTER_LOC_IDs; the DATA_IDs and duplicate DATA_IDs (using V_SYS_MOE_DATA_ID); the 
SYS_TIME_STAMP and duplicate SYS_TIME_STAMPs. In addition, the number of MOE_BORE_HOLE_IDs that have been used for the particular 
MOE_WELL_ID (using V_SYS_MOE_LOCATIONS).

#### V_SYS_CHK_MOE_WELL_ID_DUP_UPD2

One of the views used to determine whether multiple boreholes have been imported that could be describing the same location.  
Using V_SYS_CHK_MOE_WELL_ID_DUP_UPD as a base, this view returns MOE_BORE_HOLE_IDs associated with both the LOC_IDs and (possibly) 
duplicate LOC_IDs.  This is only looking for MOE_BORE_HOLE_ID counts of [1]; this removes the complication of having grouped MOE 
locations with a null MOE_BORE_HOLE_ID (for non-duplicates) indicative of a manual import of a borehole with a subsequent MOE WWDB import.

#### V_SYS_CHK_MOE_WELL_ID_DUP_UPD3

One of the views used to determine whether multiple boreholes have been imported that could be describing the same location.  
Using V_SYS_CHK_MOE_WELL_ID_DUP_UPD as a base, this view returns MOE_BORE_HOLE_IDs where the LOC_ID matches the LOC_MASTER_LOC_ID 
(i.e. either a single or master location) and the duplicate LOC_ID and LOC_MASTER_LOC_ID match as well (there is a one-to-one 
relationship in both cases).  This should allow for relatively easy comparison between the two locations.

#### V_SYS_CHK_MOE_WELL_ID_DUP_UPD4

One of the views used to determine whether multiple boreholes have been imported that could be describing the same location.  
Using V_SYS_CHK_MOE_WELL_ID_DUP_UPD3 as a base, this view returns each of the Audit Number (LOC_ALIAS_TYPE_CODE of [2]), 
ATAG Number (LOC_ALIAS_TYPE_CODE of [1]), the MOE_BORE_HOLE_ID (LOC_ALIAS_TYPE_CODE of [3]) as well as the MOE_WELL_ID 
(LOC_ALIAS_TYPE_CODE of [4]) for each LOC_ID and duplicate LOC_ID.

#### V_SYS_CHK_MOE_WELL_ID_DUP_UPD5

One of the views used to determine whether multiple boreholes have been imported that could be describing the same location.  
Using V_SYS_CHK_MOE_WELL_ID_DUP_UPD3 as a base, this view returns records from D_GEOLOGY_FEATURE that can be transferred 
from the duplicate LOC_ID (normally, this information would not be manually entered for a non-MOE well).

#### V_SYS_CHK_MOE_WELL_ID_DUP_UPD6

One of the views used to determine whether multiple boreholes have been imported that could be describing the same location.

duplicate LOC_ID (normally, this information would not be manually entered for a non-MOE well).

#### V_SYS_CHK_MOE_WELL_ID_DUP_UPD7

One of the views used to determine whether multiple boreholes have been imported that could be describing the same location.  
Using V_SYS_CHK_MOE_WELL_ID_DUP_UPD6 as a base, this view returns records from D_PUMPTEST_STEP that can be transferred from 
the duplicate LOC_ID (normally, this information would not be manually entered for a non-MOE well).

#### V_SYS_CHK_MOE_WELL_ID_LON

This returns the MOE_WELL_ID from the D_LOCATION_ALIAS table based upon the LOC_ALIAS_TYPE_CODE (of [4]) as well as assembling 
the MOE_WELL_ID from the LOC_ORIGINAL_NAME (i.e. [LON]) from D_LOCATION. It should be used as an error checking mechanism with 
regard to the correct assignment of the WELL_ID for the location.

Note that only certain LOC_TYPE_CODEs are evaluated (i.e. [Well or Borehole], [Archive], [Decommissioning Record], [MOE Error] or 
[MOE Upgrade/Maintenance Well Record]).  In addition, the LOC_ORIGINAL_NAME must be seven characters long and be numeric.

#### V_SYS_CHK_MON_BOT_GT_BOT_ELEV

This view checks if the elevation of the bottom of any screen (from D_INTERVAL_MONITOR) is below the elevation of the bottom of the borehole (from D_BOREHOLE).  Note that a value of '0.001' is added to the former to account for slight rounding errors introduced during data entry.

#### V_SYS_CHK_PARAM_UNITS_DIT1B

Returns a count of records that are associated with a particular combined RD_NAME_CODE and UNIT_CODE along with their descriptions.  This should be used to consolidate the original records into consistent units.

#### V_SYS_CHK_PARAM_UNITS_DIT1B_MGL

Returns the recalculated values (as necessary) for any units associated with 
temperature 'C' as defined by the UNIT_DEFAULT field in R_UNIT_CODE.  This 
is limited to those RD_NAME_CODEs that have a RD_NAME_DEFAULT_UNIT set to 'C'.
The 'new' units are indicated and can be used to update the associated fields.

#### V_SYS_CHK_PARAM_UNITS_DIT1B_RNC_MGL

Returns the recalculated values (as necessary) for any units associated with 
the units 'mg/L' as defined by the UNIT_DEFAULT field in R_UNIT_CODE.  This 
is limited to those RD_NAME_CODEs that have a RD_NAME_DEFAULT_UNIT set to
'mg/L'.  The 'new' units are indicated and can be used to update the associated fields.

#### V_SYS_CHK_PARAM_UNITS_DIT1B_RNC_OOO

Returns the recalculated values (as necessary) for any units associated with the 
units [o/oo] as defined by the UNIT_DEFAULT field in R_UNIT_CODE.  This is limited to 
those RD_NAME_CODEs that have a RD_NAME_DEFAULT_UNIT set to [o/oo].  The new units 
are indicated and can be used to update the associated fields.

#### V_SYS_CHK_PARAM_UNITS_DIT1B_RNC_PERC

Returns the recalculated values (as necessary) for any units associated with 
the units '%' (i.e. percentage) as defined by the UNIT_DEFAULT field in R_UNIT_CODE.  This

the units 'uS/cm' as defined by the UNIT_DEFAULT field in R_UNIT_CODE.  This 
is limited to those RD_NAME_CODEs that have a RD_NAME_DEFAULT_UNIT set to
'uS/cm'.  The 'new' units are indicated and can be used to update the associated fields.

#### V_SYS_CHK_PARAM_UNITS_DIT1B_UGL

Returns recalculated values for parameters with a reading group of [Chemistry - Metals (Water &/or Soil/Rock)], [Water - VOCs], [Water - Pesticides & Herbicides], [PAHs (Water &/or Soil/Rock)], [Water - Miscellaneous Organics], [SVOCs (Water &/or Soil/Rock)] or [PHCs (Water &/or Soil/Rock)] converting their current units (of various form) to ug/L.

#### V_SYS_CHK_PARAM_UNITS_EQUIV

Using the DEFAULT_UNIT field in R_UNIT_CODE, this view returns the current unit code and description matched to the preferred 
unit code (and related description).  This is used by the various value conversion routines (usually for temporal data).

#### V_SYS_CHK_PICK_ABOVE_GND_BELOW_BOT

Returns all records from D_PICK along with calculations comparing the pick elevation (i.e. TOP_ELEV) with the ground 
elevation (i.e. GND_ELEV).  If this elevation is above the ground surface, a value of [1] is stored in 
DIFF_PICK_GND_ELEV_TOP_ELEV.  If this elevation is below the bottom of the borehole, a value of [1] is stored in 
DIFF_TOP_ELEV_BH_BOTTOM_ELEV.  In addition, the TOP_ELEV is compared with the BH_GND_ELEV and ASSIGNED_ELEV values.

#### V_SYS_CHK_PICK_ELEV

This view compares the GND_ELEV (from D_PICK) with that of BH_GND_ELEV (from D_BOREHOLE) and ASSIGNED_ELEV (from D_LOCATION_ELEV), calculating their differences.  If either of these differences (which should contain the same value) are greater than an absolute value of '0.1m' the resultant row(s) are returned.  The difference can be added to TOP_ELEV (and GND_ELEV) as a correction factor.

#### V_SYS_CHK_PICK_ELEV_CMP

Using the views V_SYS_PICK_\*, assembles picks for all formations (idenfified
by numeric layer) for each LOC_ID (using D_BOREHOLE as a master list of
locations).  This can be used to check for invalid picks with regard to
elevations of the ordered layers (i.e. the layers should have descending
elevation values). 

The possible layer names, their abbreviations and order are:

1. Late stage glaciolacustrine
    + LATESTG
    + LS
2. Halton/Kettleby Till

#### V_SYS_CHK_PICK_ELEV_CMP_\*

Using V_SYS_CHK_PICK_ELEV_CMP as a base, looks for erroneous picks for a
particular geologic layer where its elevation exceeds that of any layers above
it or is lower than that of any layers below it.

#### V_SYS_CHK_PICK_GEOL_UNIT_CODE

Using the text found in FORMATION (in the case of a [multi-pick], the final
[Top of ...] text is used), determines the appropriate GEOL_UNIT_CODE (from
R_GEOL_UNIT_CODE) to be assigned for the particular record.  This allows
for standardized comparison.

#### V_SYS_CHK_PICK_ORIG_GND_ELEV

This view compares the original ground elevation (from D_LOCATION_ELEV_HIST using a LOC_ELEV_CODE of '2', i.e. 'Original') with the GND_ELEV from D_PICK.  If the difference is larger than +/- 1, a record is returned.  Note that SYS_RECORD_ID is from D_PICK.

#### V_SYS_CHK_PICK_ORIG_GND_ELEV_DIFF

This view returns a variety of information using V_SYS_CHK_PICK_ORIG_GND_ELEV as a base.  It is to be used to evaluate pick errors from D_PICK.

#### V_SYS_CHK_SCREEN_ASSUMED

Returns a variety of locational and other information associated with intervals to which an [Assumed Screen] has been 
assigned; this is used for error checking as these intervals have been seen to be problematic in some cases (usually to 
do with the observed static water level)

#### V_SYS_CHK_SEARCH

This view assembles the names, coordinates and various elevations that can be used when examining issues with, for example, 
water level surfaces (e.g. the presence of bulleys)

#### V_SYS_CHK_SEARCH_XYR

This is a pre-defined routine that allow the user to search within a specified distance (as determined by [SYS_SEARCH_RADIUS]) 
from specified coordinates (as set by [SYS_SEARCH_XY]).  Note that both of these constands are found in S_CONSTANT; 
the latter makes use of both VALF (for the x-coordinate) and VALF2 (for the y-coordinate).  These would need to be set by the 
user in advance of using this view.

Note that this was originally created as a means by which to check on locations based upon a given coordinate in order to fix 
errors in the calculation of the average water level.

#### V_SYS_CHK_SPEC_CAP_CALC

This view returns calculated values of specific capacity, using V_SYS_SPEC_CAP_CALC as a source, that do not already appear in D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2 (by interval and date).  Note that the RD_NAME_CODE '748' (i.e. 'Specific Capacity') is returned and used as a check.  The calculated specific capacity cannot be a NULL value. 

#### V_SYS_CHK_WLS_GEOL_UNIT_RD_UNIT

This view compares water level elevation values and geology layer elevation values based upon their OUOM units.  Where the average water level elevation is below that of the bottom of the borehole, the GEOL_UNIT_OUOM and RD_UNIT_OUOM values are returned along with the count of number of records.  Note that UGAIS wells are specifically ignored (using V_SYS_UGAIS_ALL).

#### V_SYS_CHK_WL_LOGGER

Calculates a new water level elevation for logger data from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2 using the original values (where present).

#### V_SYS_CHK_WL_MIN_GT_BOT_ELEV

This view checks if the elevation of the lowest water level (from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2) is below the elevation of the bottom of the borehole (from D_BOREHOLE).  Note that a value of '0.001' is added to the former to account for slight rounding errors introduced during data entry.  The minimum water level is determined using V_SYS_WATERLEVELS_RANGE.

#### V_SYS_CHK_WL_OUOM_CORR

Returns calculated depths (in [mbref]) for those records in D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2 with a UNIT_CODE of [6] (i.e. [masl]) and 
with the OUOM values and units stored as [above probe] (e.g. as [cmap uncomp uncal], [map uncal] or [map uncomp uncal]).  
The reference elevation is matched using V_SYS_INT_REF_ELEV_RANGE.

#### V_SYS_CHK_WL_RUO_REF_ELEV

This view checks for those water level logger records where RD_VALUE is [0],
the RD_VALUE_OUOM matches the reference elevation and the RD_UNIT_OUOM is
[mbref].

This appears to be a problem with York database records

#### V_SYS_CHK_WL_STATIC

Calculates a new water level elevation for manual data from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2 using the original values (where present).

#### V_SYS_CHK_WL_STATIC_CMP

Extracts the RD_DATE and RD_VALUE for every static water level in D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2 along with the average logger water 
level within a plus/minus one-hour interval.  The number of logger values are record and the difference between the manual 
and logger water level is calculated.

A combination of a NULL value for LOGGER_RD_VALUE with a non-NULL value for LOGGER_RCOUNT indicates that the RD_VALUE 
for the logger data is not populated.  If the LOGGER_RCOUNT value is also NULL then no logger data exists to match against 
the manual water level.

#### V_SYS_CONST_ELEV_RANGE

Returns the value of the constant SYS_ELEV_RANGE as specified in S_CONSTANT.  This uses the 
value stored in the field VALF (i.e. a floating point value).

#### V_SYS_DATETIME_STR

Returns the current datetime.  In addition, converts this datetime to a text string as well as breaking out each of its 
component parts as both numeric and text.  It also creates a SYS_TEMP1 and SYS_TEMP2 compatible format.

#### V_SYS_DBLIST_FIELDS

Returns a list of fields/columns (as FIELD_NAME) present within the ORMPG database.  These include all fields found in 
both tables and views (refer to V_SYS_DBLIST_VIEWS for exceptions).

#### V_SYS_DBLIST_FIELDS_INFO

Returns a list of fields/columns (as FIELD_NAME) and their associated characteristics as present within the ORMPG database.

#### V_SYS_DBLIST_TABLES_REMOVED

Compares the TABLE_NAME from S_DESC_TABLE against a current list of tables using 
V_SYS_DBLIST_TABLES returning those that are present in the former but not in the 
latter.  These have been removed from the database and should be removed from S_DESC_TABLE.

#### V_SYS_DBLIST_VIEWS

Returns a list of views (as VIEW_NAME) present within the ORMPG database.  Those with the prefix [VSFX] are ignored.

#### V_SYS_DBLIST_VIEWS_MISSING

Returns a list of views (as VIEW_NAME), using V_SYS_DBLIST_VIEWS as a source, that are not present within S_DESC_VIEWS.

#### V_SYS_DBLIST_VIEWS_REMOVED

Compares the VIEW_NAME from S_DESC_VIEW against a current list of views using 
V_SYS_DBLIST_VIEWS returning those that are present in the former but not in the latter.  
These have been removed from the database and should be removed from S_DESC_VIEW.

by location and GEOL_MAT1_CODE.  In addition, the total number of differing materials 
for GEOL_MAT1_CODE is also returned.

#### V_SYS_DGL_TOTAL_GEOL_MAT1_MAX

Using V_SYS_DGL_TOTAL_GEOL_MAT1 as a base, returns the thickest GEOL_MAT1_CODE material found at a location.

#### V_SYS_DGL_TOTAL_GRAVEL

Calculates the total gravel thickness present at a particular location (by LOC_ID).  
Note that only GEOL_MAT1_CODE is examined with multiple unit thicknesses summed; a 
[0] value is returned if no gravel is present.  In addition, the top- and bottom-elevation 
must be populated.

#### V_SYS_DGL_TOTAL_SAND_GRAVEL

Calculates the total sand and gravel thickness present at a particular location (by LOC_ID).  
Note that only GEOL_MAT1_CODE is examined with multiple unit thicknesses summed; a [0] 
value is returned if no sand and gravel is present.  In addition, the top- and bottom-elevation
must be populated.

#### V_SYS_DIFAF_ASSIGN

This view examines the contents of D_INTERVAL_FORM_ASSIGN then returns the
'final' geologic unit to be assigned to an interval based upon the preferred geologic
model for the particular location (refer to Section 2.4.1 for a description of
the assignment details).  This can be used to populate
D_INTERVAL_FORM_ASSIGN_FINAL.

#### V_SYS_DIFA_ASSIGNED_FINAL

This view returns the assigned 'final' geologic unit to the particular
interval.  The units descriptive text is included.

#### V_SYS_DIFA_CMP

Returns the assigned geologic unit and unit code (from D_INTERVAL_FORM_ASSIGN)
for each interval from the variety of geologic models under examination; this
currently includes CM2004, YT32011, WB2018 and WB2021

#### V_SYS_DIFA_GL

This is the base view for a number of routines/views accessing the
D_INTERVAL_FORM_ASSIGN table.  In particular, it is used to generate the
information necessary to determine the penetration of the interval (i.e.
GL_SCREEN_M) into an aquifer as part of the Transmissivity and Hydraulic
Conductivity calculation (refer to V_SYS_PUMP_MOE_TRANS_SOURCE). The following
tables and views are accessed: V_SYS_GENERAL_INTERVAL; V_SYS_INT_MON_MAX_MIN;
D_INTERVAL_FORM_ASSIGN; R_GEOL_UNIT_CODE (for determining if a given layer is
classified as an AQUIFER). Both the MON_TOP_ELEV and MON_BOT_ELEV values must
be non-null.

If the top layer matches the bottom layer (with regard to the screen top and
bottom), the length of the screen is considered for penetration.  If the
bottom layer, only, is considered an aquifer, the distance from the bottom to
the bottom of the prevous layer is considered (this is also the default if no
condition is otherwise met). If the top layer, only, is considered an aquifer,
the distance from the top to the top of the next layer is considered. 

#### V_SYS_DIFA_GL_ASSIGN

This view determines the appropriate ASSIGNED_UNIT, by geologic model and
interval, based upon: the top and bottom units encountered by the screen;
whether either is an aquifer; the degree of penetration of the geologic layer
by the screen; etc...  The coding for the view should be examined for complete
details.

#### V_SYS_DIFA_GL_[geologic unit]

Using V_SYS_DIFA_GL as a base, returns all records from D_INTERVAL_FORM_ASSIGN for 
which the interval has an assigned formation of [geologic unit].  Note that, currently 
(as of 20200622), either of the top or bottom of the interval must lie within the formation.

#### V_SYS_DIFA_GL_[geologic unit]_[model]

Using V_SYS_DIFA_GL_[geologic unit] as a base, returns those records from
D_INTERVAL_FORM_ASSIGN that correspond to the specified [model].

#### V_SYS_DIFA_GL_MOD_[model]

Using V_SYS_DIFA_GL as a base, returns those records that pass some error
checks and that correspond to the specified [model].  These
checks include: having valid top and bottom screen depths; the bottom depth
must be greater than the top depth; the top depth must be greater than or
equal to zero; the bottom depth must be greater than zero.

Note that this is used as part of the process for calculating the Transmissivity 
and Hydraulic Conductivity for the particular interval.

#### V_SYS_DIT1_INT_PAR_DAY

Extracts every parameter from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_1A/B with the original
SAM_SAMPLE_DATE converted to a string in the format [yyyymmdd].  The parameter
name and units are also present.  As any parameter can be recorded multiple
times on a particular day the minimum, maximum, count and average value is
returned.  This view can be used as a base to create a table-format
spreadsheet for examination of parameter changes over time for a particular
interval.

#### V_SYS_DIT_COUNTS

Returns the number of records as found in each of the temporal tables related
through INT_ID (and the associated LOC_ID).  Note that the counts from 1A are
the number of samples while the counts from 1B are the number of parameters.

#### V_SYS_DOC_BH_NONMOE_LOCNS

This view returns a list of the non-MOE PDFs assembled within the ORMGP Report
Library. By default, these are entitled [\<LOC_ID\>.pdf] and are stored within
the DOC_FOLDER_ID [10000].  This relies upon a definition of
LOC_ALIAS_TYPE_CODE of [6] (i.e. Borehole Document Name) in D_LOCATION_ALIAS
with the LOC_ID stored in the LOC_ALIAS_NAME field.

#### V_SYS_DOC_LAST_MODIFIED

Examining the SYS_TIME_STAMP and SYS_LAST_MODIFIED fields in D_LOCATION and 
D_DOCUMENT, returns the most recent date as DOC_LAST_MODIFIED.

#### V_SYS_DOC_REPLIB_ENTRY

#### V_SYS_ELEV_ASSIGNED_ALL

This view returns all elevations associated with a particular location (by LOC_ID).  Note that these include:

* Assigned Elevation (from D_LOCATION_ELEV)
* Surveyed (LOC_ELEV_CODE '1' - 'Surveyed') as LOC_ELEV_MASL_SURV
* Original Elevation (LOC_ELEV_CODE '2' - 'Original') as LOC_ELEV_MASL_ORIG
* Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) Digital Elevation Model (DEM), version 2 (10m resolution; LOC_ELEV_CODE '3' - 'DEM - MNR 10m v2') as LOC_ELEV_MASL_MNRV2

#### V_SYS_EXAMPLE_SHEET_\*

These views return location and interval data, from the database, in the format required for manual data entry using the spreadsheet(s) as described in Section 3.4.  These are to be used to provide familiar example information to requisite partner agencies whom are undergoing entry of data into a database-friendly format outside of the SiteFX environment.  The resultant rows should be included in the file sent to the partner agency as example worksheets (in addition to the blank, data entry sheets).  Note that fields with NULL values are converted to empty strings for incorporating into spreadsheets.

The example data extracted include each of the following:

#### V_SYS_FIELD_WATERLEVELS_DAILY

This view returns the calculated daily average water level for both logger (RD_NAME_CODE '629') and manual (RD_NAME_CODE '628') data for each interval, if available.  Only those rows in D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2 with UNIT_CODE '6' (i.e. 'masl') are included.  Note that the maximum SYS_RECORD_ID is included for referencing (i.e. in order to distinguish between rows in the resultant dataset).  The datetime field (RD_DATE) is modified, dropping the hour and minute data.

#### V_SYS_FIELD_WATERLEVELS_YEARLY

This view returns the water level minimum, maximum, difference and total number of records for each interval for each year of data.  Note that data from RD_NAME_CODEs '628' (i.e. 'Water Level - Manual - Static') and '629' (i.e. 'Water Level - Logger (Compensated & Corrected)') are combined for these calculations.  Only those records with UNIT_CODE '6' (i.e. 'masl') are included.

#### V_SYS_GEN_WL_AVERAGE

This view, using V_SYS_CHK_INT_ELEVS_DEPTHS as a source, returns those records where WL_MASL_AVG is not null and the QA_COORD_CONFIDENCE_CODE is less than '6' (i.e. 'Margin of Error: 300m - 1km'; the uncertainty, then, would be less than 300m horizontal).  Both the spatial geometry (from D_LOCATION_GEOM) and the coordinates (from D_LOCATION) are included.  This can then be used for creating regional water level surfaces.

#### V_SYS_GENERAL

This view extracts locations from D_LOCATION with valid coordinates (i.e. not having a QA_COORD_CONFIDENCE_CODE of '117').  Note that documents (LOC_TYPE_CODE '25') and the 'Viewlog Well Header' location (i.e. LOC_ID '-2147483443') are not included.  This is used as a base for many V_GEN_* views.

#### V_SYS_GENERAL_INTERVAL

This view extracts all intervals from D_INTERVAL that are present in V_SYS_GENERAL; refer to V_SYS_GENERAL, above.  This is used as a base for many V_GEN_* views that include interval information.

#### V_SYS_GEN_BH_INT_MUNIC_WELL

Peel, Durham and Toronto – Conservation Authorities Moraines Coalition (YPDT- CAMC) Study Area (December 2017).  Unpublished 
Technical Report.], Figure 16 in particular.

#### V_SYS_LAB_WATER_TYPE_MHM_AVG

Similar to the classification scheme outlined in V_SYS_LAB_WATER_TYPE_MHM (refer to that view for further details).  In this case, all 
samples are used to determine an average of each anion and cation for the final calculation of water type (instead of on a sample-by-sample basis).  
The numeric values returned correspond to standard Piper diagram hydrochemical facies and have the following equivalents: Type A has value [5]; 
Type B has value [6]; Type C has value [7]; and Type D has value [8].  The [Mixed Type] (i.e. value [9]) is not defined with these methods.  
Note that a returned value of [0] indicates an undefined type by the methodology.

calculate Transmissivity and Hydraulic Conductivity using the process outlined
by Bradbury and Rothschild (1985).  Equations from this paper has been broken
down into component parts for ease of calculation.  The view V_SYS_PUMP_MOE_TRANS_SOURCE2 is used as a source of information.  The final equations are assembled and calculated here - the only checks, here,  are to avoid divide-by-zero issues.  Calculated values are used to update D_INTERVAL_FORM_ASSIGN.

Checks are made, here, to avoid calculation errors as well as determining the point at which the calculation will start and finsh (below a specified error).  For example: a null T_ITER (number of iterations) or T_ERR (calculated error) indicates that calculations can commence; a T_ERR less than a default error allwos calculations to finish; a T_ITER below a maximum iteration allows the calculation to continue.
