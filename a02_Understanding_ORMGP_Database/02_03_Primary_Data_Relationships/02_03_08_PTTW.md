## Section 2.3.8 Permit To Take Water (PTTW)

The PTTW data is provided as a single spreadsheet by the Ministry of
Environment and requires manipulation before incorporation into the ORMGP
database.  The PERMITNO field, the primary designator by which a PTTW is
identified, is not unique and can refer to multiple records within the
spreadsheet.  As such, a number of fields are examined and, where they have
matching values, grouped in order to capture the distinct data pertinent to
each PERMITNO.  The means by which this is accomplished is described in
**Appendix G.22**.  This includes the specific details concerning the import
of of *new* PTTW locations.

The actual fields that are examined for duplication (of rows) are:

* PERMITNO
* CLIENTNAME
* PURPOSECAT
* SPURPOSE
* EXPIRYDATE
* ISSUEDDATE
* RENEWDATE
* OLDCTYTWN
* P_LOT
* P_CON
* P_MUNICIP
* P_UPPERT
* P_LOWERT
* SURFGRND
* SOURCEID
* EASTING
* NORTHING
* UTMZONE
* MAXL_DAY
* DAYS_YEAR
* HRS_DAYMAX
* L_MINUTE
* AMENDED_BY
* EXPIRED_BY
* ACTIVE
* PERMIT_END

The tables into which the Permit information is added are described below.
The mapping between the field within the particular table and the column name
within the PTTW spreadsheet is indicated.

##### D_OWNER

+ OWN_NAME - CLIENTNAME
    + The CLIENTNAME from the dataset is matched against existingnames within
    the D_OWNER table; if there is a match, that OWN_ID is stored within the
    D_LOC table; if not, a new recored is added to this table

##### D_LOC

* LOC_NAME - PERMITNO
    + This is the permit number for the particular water taking
* LOC_TYPE_CODE - 22
    + R_LOC_TYPE_CODE - *Permit To Take Water [22]*
* OWN_ID
    + This numeric value is extracted from the D_OWNER table based upon the
    CLIENTNAME in the PTTW dataset
* STATUS_CODE - 19 (or 27)
    + R_STATUS_CODE - *Active PTTW [19]* (or *Expired PTTW [27]*)
    + Note that the value used to populate this field will be based upon the
    EXPIRYDATE of the particular permit; for example, if the current date
    takes place after the EXPIRYDATE, a code of *27* would be assigned; there
    is an underlying process within the database to update this field as
    appropriate (generally a weekly check)
* LOC_START_DATE - ISSUEDDATE
    + The date at which the permit was issued
    + Refer to LOC_END_DATE for details
* LOC_END_DATE - EXPIRYDATE
    + The date at which the permit expires
    + Any invalid dates (usually found as a blank field in the source data)
    are assigned the tag *1867-07-01*; any invalid years (these are usually
    greater than *2050*) are similarly changed to *1867*

This table is linked to D_OWNER through the OWN_ID field.

##### D_LOC_ADDRESS

* LOC_LOT - P_LOT
    + The lot where the permit is located
    + The source data is generally a free-form field; as such, it can include
    lot numbers, concession numbers and general addresss; if a straight
    numeric (whole number) can be identified, it is stored within this field
* LOC_CON - P_CON
    + The concession where the permit is located
    + This format is similar as to that described for P_LOT (above); a
    straight numeric (whole number), if available, will be stored here
* LOC_ADDRESS_INFO1 - P_LOT
    + As the source is a free-form field, the contents of P_LOT are also
    included here
* LOC_ADDRESS_INFO2 - P_CON
    + As the source is a free-form field, the contents of P_CON are also
    included here
* LOC_TOWNSHIP_CODE
    + R_TOWNSHIP_CODE - P_MUNICIP
    + The current municipality where the permit is located; the text from
    P_MUNICIP is matched to that in R_TOWNSHIP_CODE; the resulting code is
    used to populated LOC_TOWNSHIP_CODE
* LOC_COUNTY_CODE
    + R_TOWNSHIP_CODE - COUNTY_CODE
    + The LOC_TOWNSHIP_CODE from R_TOWNSHIP_CODE will be used to determine the
    COUNTY_CODE value

This table is linked to D_LOC through the LOC_ID field.

##### D_LOC_SPATIAL_HIST

* X - EASTING
* Y - NORTHING
    + Where the UTMZONE has a value of *17*, the **X** and **Y** values are
    populated with the indicated fields; otherwise, the values are translated
    from those in **X_OUOM**, **Y_OUOM* and **EPSG_CODE_OUOM**; the assumed
    datum is NAD83
* EPSG_CODE - 26917
    + Refer to **Section 2.3.1** for details concerning the population of this
    field
* QA_COORD_CODE - 5 (or 117)
    + R_QA_COORD_CODE - *Margin of Error : 100 m - 300 m [5]* (or *Coordinate
    Invalid [117]*)
    + The default QA_COORD_CODE is *5* for PTTW locations; if no coordinates
    are available in any of the available source fields, a value of *117* is
    applied instead
* X_OUOM - EASTING (or LONGITUDE)
* Y_OUOM - NORTHING (or LATITUDE)
    + Where the UTMZONE does not have a value of *17*, the **X_OUOM** and
    **Y_OUOM** fields are populated with the indicated fields; these are then
    used to calculated the coordinates to store in **X** and **Y**
* EPSG_CODE_OUOM
    + The particular EPGS code relative to the coordinate values stored in
    **X_OUOM** and **Y_OUOM** is stored here; refer to **Section 2.3.1** for
    details concerning these codes

This table is linked to D_LOC through the LOC_ID field.

##### D_LOC_PURPOSE_HIST

* PURPOSE_PRI_CODE
    + R_PURPOSE_PRI_CODE - PURPOSECAT
    + This the major takings category
    + The PURPOSECAT from the source data is matched to the primary purposes
    listed in R_PURPOSE_PRI_CODE table; the resulting code is stored here; in
    the case of a *Municipal* purpose, evaluate whether *Exploration*,
    *Monitoring* or *Supply* purposes would apply (the latter is the most
    likely)
* PURPOSE_SEC_CODE
    + R_PURPOSE_SEC_CODE - SPURPOSE
    + This is the specific purpose of the water takings
    + The SPURPOSE from the source data is matched to the secondary purposes
    found in R_PURPOSE_SEC_CODE table; the resulting code is stored here

This table is linked to D_LOC through the LOC_ID field.  Note that more than a
single pair of purposes can be assigned to each location.  The current (or
most important) purpose pair is specified through the D_LOC_PURPOSE table.

##### D_LOC_PTTW

* PTTW_SRCID_CODE 
    + R_PTTW_SRCID_CODE - SOURCEID
    + The SOURCEID is used to determine the particular PTTW_SRCID_CODE to
    store within this field; this text description is stored in
    PTTW_SRCID_OUOM
* PTTW_SRCID_OUOM - SOURCEID
    + This is a free-form text field and is used to capture the SOURCEID text
    used to populated the PTTW_SRCID_CODE field
* PTTW_WATERSRC_CODE
    + R_PTTW_WATERSRC_CODE - SURFGRND
    + This is an indicator of the water source for the permit and is one of
    surface, groundwater or both
* PTTW_MAX_L_DAY
    + Maximum litres allowed per day
* PTTW_MAX_DAYS_YEAR
    + Number of days within a year that water taking is permissible
* PTTW_MAX_HRS_DAY
    + The maximum number of hours per day that water taking is permissible
* PTTW_MAX_L_MINUTE
    + The maximum pumping rate per minute for water taking
* PTTW_AMENDED_BY
    + The permit number that amends the current permit number
* PTTW_EXPIRED_BY
    + The permit number that takes the expires this permit number
* PTTW_PERMIT_END
    + Date at which the permit ends
* PTTW_RENEWDATE - RENEWDATE
    + This is the date that a legacy permit (i.e. those permits issued before
    2005) was renewed; note that in some instances, this value was present as
    a numeric (representing a datetime) rather than an actual date string;
    this should be converted from the source data before incorporation

This table is linked to D_LOC through the LOC_ID field.

#### Permit To Take Water - Unused Fields

The following source field data are not imported into the ORMGP database:

* OLDCTYTWN
    + The former township name related to the lot and concession of the
    permit; this value seems to match that of P_MUNICIP (in most cases)
+ P_UPPERT
    + The upper tier where the permit is located; this relates to county,
    district or regional municipality
+ P_LOWERT 
    + The lower tier where the permit is located
+ ACTIVE
    + This states whether the permit is active or has expired (by a *yes* or
    *no*) based on the PERMIT_END field; note that this is captured by
    STATUS_CODE in D_LOC
